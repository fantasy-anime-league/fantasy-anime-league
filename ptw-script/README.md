# ptw-script

Script to get PTW count of all anime in a certain season

## Running the script

1. Set the season and year in `config.py`.
2. Run the script.
    ```shell
    $ python ptw-script.py
    ```

## Output

The script will generate a CSV file with the name in the format `<season>-<year>-<date>.csv`.

For example, I ran the script on Spring 2019 on January 17, 2019. The filename was `Spring-2019-2019-01-19.csv`.
