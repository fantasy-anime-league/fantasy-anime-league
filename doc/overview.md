# Overview

## Introduction

The [Fantasy Anime League](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=738) (FAL) is similar to [fantasy sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_sport) but with an anime twist. Basically, players form their own teams by selecting anime from the upcoming season. Once the teams are chosen, everyone sits back and watches their teams rack up points according to criteria that is posted. You don't even need to watch the anime you've chosen. If you wish to be more active, FAL offers you some strategic elements.

## Stages

FAL consists of a few stages. Here is a brief description of each stage.

### [Preseason](preseason.md)

This is the period of time before the season starts.

#### Anime list compilation

The FAL staff compiles the set of anime that will air for the next game season. When that season starts, FAL players will compose their teams with that set of anime.

#### Registration

Players select 7 anime to create their roster, which consists of 5 main anime and 2 bench anime. During the season, the players may choose to swap out their main anime for those on the bench.

During the days up to the registration deadline, the FAL staff will process teams to prepare them for the game. There may be registration errors, which require teams to fix and resubmit.

### [During the game](midseason.md)

Once per week, points are calculated for each team. The points depend on a variety of factors such as the number of people currently watching an anime, the number of forum posts in an anime's episode discussion threads, special player strategies, and so on.

### Finale
